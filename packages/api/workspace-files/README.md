# @deepseek-ai/dsh-api-workspace-files

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

## Summary

`@deepseek-ai/dsh-api-workspace-files` owns the Host `ctx.workspaceFiles` service and the generated Client `workspaceFiles` Remote namespace: `read` returns one page of lines from a UTF-8 text file, `readBytes` returns one window of raw bytes from any regular file, `stat` returns a file's version and size without its content, `list` returns one directory's direct children, and `changes` streams every filesystem observation an Agent makes inside the Session's workspace root. All five run over the composed `ctx.fs` and confine themselves to the workspace root the sandbox policy resolves for the addressed Session; the filesystem backend's own cwd never decides. Client packages reach the namespace through the [`api-remotes`](../../api/remotes/README.md) assembly. The package's `./client` export registers the `file` resource provider that turns `stat` and `changes` into live file metadata for `useResource<'file'>`; the Sidebar's file tree tab lists directories through `list`.

## Use this package

Mount the package beside `dsh-fs`, `dsh-sandbox-policy`, and the Typert Gateway; the bundle does so right after the Session Controller. Every method takes the Session identity on the wire, so a Client calls `remote.workspaceFiles.read(agent, path, range, signal)`, `stat(agent, path, signal)`, `readBytes(agent, path, range, signal)`, `list(agent, path, signal)`, or `changes(agent, signal)` and never names a root itself.

| Method | Returns | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `stat(path)` | `WorkspaceFileStat { absolutePath, version, bytes? }` | Identity, version, and size of one regular file, without content |
| `read(path, { offset?, limit? })` | `WorkspaceFileText` = stat + `{ offset, text, lines, eof }` | One window of lines from a UTF-8 text file; `lines` counts them, so one empty line and a page past the end read differently |
| `readBytes(path, { offset?, length? })` | `WorkspaceFileBytes` = stat + `{ offset, data, eof }` | One window of raw bytes from any regular file, base64-encoded |
| `list(path)` | `WorkspaceDirectoryListing { path, entries, truncated }` | Direct children of one directory |
| `changes()` | stream of `WorkspaceFileWatchFrame` | Subscription readiness, then Agent observations inside the workspace root |

### Addressing and paths

`read`, `stat`, and `list` accept a workspace path that is absolute or relative to the Session's workspace root. Two path vocabularies leave the service, and each method uses exactly one: `read`, `stat`, and `changes` report a file as its absolute path in the filesystem's execution world, symlinks resolved (`WorkspaceFileStat.absolutePath`, `WorkspaceFileChange.absolutePath`), because their consumer is the Client resource system, which follows changes by that path; `list` reports the listed directory as a workspace path relative to the root — empty for the root itself — because its consumer is a tree rooted there, and a child's path is that value joined with the entry name by `/`.

### Pages

`read` returns one line window, never the whole file. `range.offset` is the 1-based first line and defaults to 1; `range.limit` is the largest number of lines on the page and defaults to `maxLines`, which it may not exceed — a larger limit, or an offset or limit that is not a positive integer, is a `gateway/bad-request`. Lines end at `\n`, and a final `\n` terminates the last line rather than starting an empty one, so a two-line file has two lines. The page's `text` joins its lines with `\n` and carries no terminator after the last; `eof` is true when the page includes the file's last line, and an offset past the end returns an empty page with `eof` true. Every page also carries the file's `version` from the stat that preceded it, so a consumer can tell a fresh page from a stale one, and `bytes`, the complete file's size when the backend reports it. The service reads the file only up to the first character past the page, so a very large file costs one page of memory per request.

### Byte windows

`read` pages by lines and never by bytes; a byte window is `readBytes`. `range.offset` is the 0-based first byte and defaults to 0; `range.length` is the largest number of bytes in the window and defaults to `maxBytes`, which it may not exceed — a longer window fails with `too-large` instead of arriving shortened, and an offset or length that is not an integer in range is a `gateway/bad-request`. The window comes back as base64 `data`, shorter than `length` at the end of the file and empty at or past it; `eof` is true when the window includes the file's last byte. Nothing is decoded and nothing is refused as binary, so an image or a NUL-laden file reads where `read` fails with `not-text`. The same `version` and `bytes` ride along as on a page.

### The four gates

Every read, stat, and listing passes four gates in this order. First, `lstat` inspects the path itself before anything follows it: a symlink, wherever it points, fails `read` and `stat` with `not-regular-file` and `list` with `not-directory`, each carrying the entry's `kind`. Second, containment: the path resolves to a target and `ctx.fs.contains(root, target)` decides, so a `..` traversal or an absolute path outside the root fails with `outside-workspace` — never a string-prefix comparison, which cannot see a realpath that leaves the root. Third, the caps: a page whose text exceeds `maxBytes` fails with `too-large` instead of arriving shortened — the file itself has no size cap — while `maxEntries` cuts a listing and sets `truncated`. Fourth, text: content that is not UTF-8 up to the end of the page, or a page that carries a NUL byte, fails with `not-text`; bytes past the page are not inspected. A missing path fails with `not-found`; an empty path is a `gateway/bad-request`.

### The change feed

`changes` is a `stream` Remote. A generation registers its observation queue and resolves the Session workspace root before yielding `{ kind: 'ready' }`. It then yields `{ kind: 'change', change }`, where `change` is `{ absolutePath, version }` for a present file or `{ absolutePath, absent: true }` for one observed gone. The source is `fs/observed`, filtered to targets inside that root; the operating system is not watched. Observations after the generation's first pull are queued, including while the root resolves. The generation ends on cancellation or plugin disposal.

### Configuration

| Field | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `maxBytes` | `2097152` (2 MiB) | Inclusive byte cap on one page's text and on one byte window; a larger page or window fails |
| `maxLines` | `5000` | Default and largest page size in lines; a larger `limit` is refused |
| `maxEntries` | `2000` | Cap on returned directory entries; the rest is dropped and reported cut |

The generated [configuration catalog](../../../docs/config-catalog.md#deepseek-aidsh-api-workspace-files) is the exhaustive source for every accepted field and its JSDoc.

### Failures

Each failure is one `RemoteError` code with typed details, declared in [`src/types.ts`](src/types.ts): `workspace-file/not-found`, `workspace-file/outside-workspace`, `workspace-file/too-large` (with `limit`, the page and window cap), `workspace-file/not-text`, `workspace-file/not-regular-file` (`kind`: `directory`, `symlink`, or `other`), and `workspace-file/not-directory` (`kind`: `file`, `symlink`, or `other`). Callers branch on the code, never on message text.

### Client file resources

The browser export registers the `file` provider into `ctx.resources` and requires `resources`, `remote`, `remote.workspaceFiles`, and `sessions`. The bundle's single `workspace-files` row supplies both faces; the Client has no separate configuration. A component follows a file through its standard `useResource<'file'>(address)` prop and reads `{ absolutePath, version, bytes?, changed }`; content is fetched separately through the paged methods.

A `session/<sessionId>/<path>` resource address sends its relative path unchanged to the Host, which resolves and confines it against that Session's workspace root; the Client needs no Session `cwd`. An `absolute/<path>` address reads through the current Session. Both use the `dsh-resource://file/` grammar in [workspace-path](../../util/workspace-path/README.md). An absolute address without a current Session produces `workspace-file/unknown-workspace`; an unsupported address produces `workspace-file/unsupported-address`. These Client failures end the stream and make reload a no-op.

The provider waits for the Host's `ready` frame before its first `stat`, queues changes during the read, then binds the follower to `stat.absolutePath`. Both queued and live changes match that Host-returned path. A new write version raises `changed` while retaining the last byte size; duplicate versions are ignored. An absent notice or reload re-stats the file. A failed stat keeps the address followed; a later write or reload can recover it, and any Session write can trigger a retry before the first successful path binding. Reload clears `changed`; a Host-triggered re-stat keeps it raised. Frames are `RemoteResult` values, and programming exceptions remain uncaught.

One supervised `changes` stream serves every followed file in a Session. Followers match absolute paths with backslashes normalized to slashes. Carrier loss reconnects through the Gateway supervisor; a Host-ended or terminally failed feed ends its followers and leaves their last metadata readable until reopened. The last follower leaving disposes the stream, a successor waits for that disposal, and plugin teardown awaits all pending closes. The provider declares `ResourceProtocolMap.file`; the text preview declares its Sidebar line-navigation parameters.

### Design concept

Reads through `ctx.fs` are deliberately unconfined — the sandboxing backend fences writes and edits only — so every constraint here is the service's own. A page is cut from `streamText`, which decodes and rejects non-UTF-8 chunk by chunk: the cutter counts lines before the window without keeping them, admits each in-window segment against the byte cap before buffering it, and returns at the first character past the window, so neither a huge file nor one giant line can hold more than a page in memory; the NUL scan then runs on the page. One `stat` before the stream names the version and size the page reports. The path gate runs before containment on purpose: `lstat` is path-shaped and sees the link, while `resolve` follows it; the price is that an entry outside the root reports its own kind before its position.

### Source map

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| [`src/index.ts`](src/index.ts) | `WorkspaceFiles`: the `workspaceFiles` service and Remote namespace, `Config`, the gates, the page cutter, `read`, `readBytes`, `stat`, `list` |
| [`src/changes.ts`](src/changes.ts) | `WorkspaceChangeFeed`: `fs/observed` subscription and one queue per open `changes` generation |
| [`src/types.ts`](src/types.ts) | Wire types and the `RemoteErrorDetailsMap` codes, published as `./types` for Client packages |
| [`src/client/index.ts`](src/client/index.ts), [`provider.ts`](src/client/provider.ts), [`change-feed.ts`](src/client/change-feed.ts) | Browser plugin, file metadata, and per-Session change feed |
| [`src/client/types.ts`](src/client/types.ts), [`remote.ts`](src/client/remote.ts) | Resource values, parameters, Client error codes, and generated Remote types |
| — | No runtime invariant companion is published; every Host answer is derived from `ctx.fs` and the sandbox policy at call time. |

Typert generates the Host and Client Remote artifacts exposed by `./typert` and `./remote`.

## Further Exploration

- [Filesystem capability](../../fs/fs/README.md) — the `ctx.fs` contract this service reads through, including `fs/observed` and `readByteRange`.
- [Sandbox policy](../../sandbox/sandbox-policy/README.md) — where the Session's workspace root comes from.
- [Remote assembly](../../api/remotes/README.md) — how Client packages reach the `workspaceFiles` namespace.
- [Client resources](../../client/resources/README.md) — the resource model, `useResource`, pins, and provider lifetime.
- [Workspace path helpers](../../util/workspace-path/README.md) — `fileAddressFor` and `parseFileAddress`, the `dsh-resource://file/…` address grammar both ends share.
- [Sidebar text preview](../../client/ui-sidebar-textpreview/README.md) — the tab type that follows a file through the `file` provider and reads its pages.

## Model Experience

None, as this package registers no tool, contributes no prompt section, and appends no session event.

#### KV Cache effect

None; this package neither assembles nor sends a provider request.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

<a id="known-limitations-and-deferred-work"></a>

- **Agent writes only** — `changes` relays `fs/observed` emissions; a file changed by a subprocess, a shell command, or the user's editor produces no frame.
- **Kind before position** — an entry outside the workspace whose type already disqualifies it reports `not-regular-file` or `not-directory`, not `outside-workspace`, because the path gate precedes containment.
- **No total line count** — a page reports `eof`, not how many lines follow; a consumer that needs the total pages to the end or estimates from `bytes`.
- **One giant line has no page** — a single line above `maxBytes` fails `too-large` at every window that includes it, because pages are cut by lines, not bytes.
- **Version precedes content** — the `version` on a page is the stat's, taken before the stream; a write landing between the two leaves the page one version behind, which the next `changes` frame reports.
- **Unbounded generation queue** — a `changes` generation buffers every contained observation until its consumer pulls; a stalled consumer grows Host memory for the life of the stream.
- **`maxEntries` bounds the answer, not the listing** — `list` asks `ctx.fs.listDir` for every child and cuts the array afterwards, so a directory far above the cap still costs the Host the whole listing (on `fs-local`, one stat per child); bounding that work needs a limit on the filesystem seam's `listDir`.
- **Dead feeds retain metadata** — after the Host ends `changes` or the stream fails terminally, open values retain their last state until reopened; reload does not reopen the stream.
- **Reload is shared by path** — a reload re-stats every follower of that absolute path in the Session and clears their `changed` flags, including readers that did not reload their content. Per-record reload delivery remains deferred.
