/**
 * The store shell over the docking kit: one surface per session, held as plain
 * data so the kit's pure functions are the only thing that ever computes a
 * layout.
 *
 * Every action follows the same steps — mint the ids the intent needs, ask the
 * kit's planner what operations carry it out, let the settle planner keep every
 * pane populated, record it all as one history entry — and then assigns the
 * session's whole surface back in one go. Nothing here reaches into a draft to
 * edit a layout in place, which is what keeps the kit testable without a store
 * and keeps snapshot identity honest.
 *
 * The settle step is this product's rule, not the kit's: a docked pane never
 * stays empty, and the last pane reseeds the guide tab, so there is always at
 * least one tab to look at.
 *
 * A focus that changes nothing — a tab already active in its already-active
 * pane, a pane already active — plans nothing and records nothing, whoever
 * asks: the kit's chip click and `ctx.sidebarRight.focus` alike.
 *
 * So is the guide's uniqueness: a pane holds at most one guide tab. Opening the
 * guide into a pane that has one focuses it, and a guide dragged, dropped, or
 * docked into such a pane merges into it — the arriving guide closes and the
 * pane's own is focused. The kit plans none of this; it is decided here before
 * its planners run.
